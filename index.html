            x Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places, or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
            x Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML
            x Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
            x Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
            x It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
            x After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.
            x Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
            x Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
            x The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
            x Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
            x Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.
            - Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
            
            
            - In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.
            - Stay within scope of what was taught so far in class. Do not write functions within your application. Avoid the use of “helper” methods such as .includes() and .join(). Work with the instructional staff directly if you have questions about this requirement.

            <p>My name is Lucy. I grew up in Colorado, and moved to Seattle for school. I have a BA in Sociology from Seattle University and a Master's in Environmental Studies from The Evergreen State College. My work experience includes:</p>
