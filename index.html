            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Lucy. I grew up in Colorado, and moved to Seattle for school. I have a BA in Sociology from Seattle University and a Master's in Environmental Studies from The Evergreen State College. I had a bunch of jobs before graduating from college (mostly in retail and fast food), but for the last decade or so, I've worked in law firm IT. When I'm not working, I like listening to podcasts, gaming, and working in my balcony garden, and cleaning up after my cats Merry and Pippin.</p>

            <p>My main goal is to get a job doing things I like (like coding) while also helping to make the world better. Ideally, I'd like to work at an environmental consulting firm or nonprofit, or in city or state government.</p>
