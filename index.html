        <!--
            - Create an About Me guessing game that utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
            x Include on your HTML page a short biography, your education history, an overview of your job experience, and any goals that you may have.
            - Prompt the user a total of exactly five yes or no questions. The user input for the answer must accept either y/n or yes/no responses while taking into consideration case sensitivity by normalizing the user input so that it can be validated (hint: look into the .toUpperCase() or .toLowerCase() functions)x Be sure to let the user know if they answered the question correctly by alerting them with a response.
            - Add console.log() messages within your app to notify the user if they are correct. Before submitting, comment out (don’t delete) your console.log() messages and replace them with the alerts() to complete the project.
            x Ask the user their name through a prompt()
            x Display that name back to the user through a custom greeting welcoming them to your site.
            - Display the user’s name back to them in your final message to the user.
            x Your JS file must contain a 'use strict' declaration at the top, and your javascript file must be linked in your html file as an external script file.
            x Make sure that all code is cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed.
            - Follow the Add, Commit, Push process. It should be evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
            
            Stretch
            - Push yourself in your CSS work. Experiment, try some layout feature or technique that you have not tried before (maybe a sticky header or sticky footer, icon fonts such as FontAwesome, etc.) or just try to refine your layout/style as much as possible.

            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Lucy. I grew up in Colorado, and moved to Seattle for school. I have a BA in Sociology from Seattle University and a Master's in Environmental Studies from The Evergreen State College. I had a bunch of jobs before graduating from college (mostly in retail and fast food), but for the last decade or so, I've worked in law firm IT. When I'm not working, I like listening to podcasts, gaming, and working in my balcony garden, and cleaning up after my cats Merry and Pippin.</p>

            <p>My main goal is to get a job doing things I like (like coding) while also helping to make the world better. Ideally, I'd like to work at an environmental consulting firm or nonprofit, or in city or state government.</p>
