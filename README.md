Overall, this project went fairly well. I was able to reuse some of the JavaScript and CSS from my 102 project, which saved some time. One thing I wanted to include but couldn't get to work was a prompt in case the user entered something other than "yes" or "no." Currently, any entry other than "yes" evaluates to "false," but the loop I tried to include never ended.

I expected this to take about an hour and a half, since I was reusing some code from a previous project. It ended up taking closer to two and a half hours, a decent chunk of which was figuring out how to get the header image from my Pictures folder into my repo.
